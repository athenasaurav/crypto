CRYPTO DASHBOARD
-----------------------
Motivation
------------
Having previously dabbled in the trading of cryptocurrency in 2016 before the huge boom and bust, I have always wondered if there was a less risky way to reap the benefits of trading and if there was a way to know when to buy or sell.

If there was a system to do this then everyone would be doing it and be rich by now but the reality is, it is possible to build a system to buy and sell crypto but the performance will depend on the quality of data and methodology chosen.

Approach
-----------
There are a few approaches that can be taken to build the system.
* **Sentiment analysis** - Scraping for sentiments on the coin and analysing to make trading decisions
* **Technical analysis** - Using the historical price of the coin to make trading decisions
* A combination of both

I decided to go for the latter for proof of concept as there is more readily available data for free to explore this method.

Techniques
-------------
During technical analysis the following systems were used to make trading decisions:
* **SMA** - Using simple moving averages to determine when to buy or sell based on the intercept of the short and long moving averages.

* **RSI** - Performing relative strength analysis on a 14 day cycle and using a threshold of 80%

Traditional machine learning was not used for this project because it doesn't add any real life value to trading as it simply applies a smoothing curve with no logic.

Performance of Models
-------------------------
* **SMA** - **Average year gains** = 0.6966840372094414%
        **Total gains** = 4.87678826046609%
* **RSI** - **Average year gains** = 3.1764317126603365%
        **Total gains** = 22.235021988622357%

Installation
----------------------

### Clone Repo

* Clone this repo to your computer.
* `myapp.py` is the executable for the app

* `data` folder contains three datasets
    * `data.py`: Extracts data from coingecko API.
    Instructions on how to use the API can be found on https://www.coingecko.com/en/api
      * `data.py` contains
      * `get_btc_price`: This method returns the current price of any crypto currency
      * `get_top_20_mc`: This method returns the top 20 cryptocurrency according to market cap in a dataframe
      * `get_historic_btc_price`: This method returns the historic bitcoin price from the date of origin. Can be used for other coins
      * `plot_top_20_mc`: This method plots the top 20 cryptocurrencies in order of market cap
      * `plot_top_20_volume`: This method plots the top 20 cryptocurrencies in order of volume
      * `plot_historic_btc_price`: This method plots the historic bitcoin price
      * `get_btc_candlesticks`: This method gets the 90 day OHLC data for bitcoin
      * `SMA`: This creates the simple moving average data for historic bitcoin data
      * `SMA_signals`: This creates the simple moving average signals for historic bitcoin data
      * `plot_SMA`: This creates the simple moving average plot for historic bitcoin data
      * `create_SMA_portfolio`: This creates the simple moving average portfolio to calculate returns
      * `calculate_SMA_pct_change`: This calculates the returns from investing in the SMA buy and sell signals
      * `plot_SMA_returns`: This calculates the returns from investing in the SMA buy and sell signals
      * `RSI`: This creates the relative strength index data for historic bitcoin data
      * `RSI_signals`: This creates the relative strength index signals for historic bitcoin data
      * `plot_RSI`: This creates the relative strength index plot for historic bitcoin data
      * `create_RSI_portfolio`: This creates the relative strength index portfolio to calculate returns
      * `calculate_RSI_pct_change`: This calculates the returns from investing in the RSI buy and sell signals
      * `plot_RSI_returns`: This calculates the returns from investing in the RSI buy and sell signals
      * `return_figures`: method that returns the json figures to plot in graphs

  * `myapp` folder contains
    * `static`: Folder containing all image files
    * `templates`: Folder containing
      * `index.html` homepage which renders when you run the app. It was designed with bootstrap
      * `trade_view.html` tradeview for bitcoin which renders when you run the app
    * `__init__.py`: Initiate flask app
    * `routes.py`: Defines the app routes
* It is recommended you run the solution in a virtual environment. Please see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html


### Install the requirements
* For mac please ensure you have xcode or download it from the app store (probably not needed)
* From your CLI install homebrew using `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
* After installing homebrew successfully, install python3 using `brew install python3`
* Check python3 installed correctly using `python3 --version` and this should return python3 version
* Install the requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
    * Make sure you use Python 3
* `cd` to the location of myapp.py (should be located in parent folder)
* Execute `python3 myapp.py`
* Follow the information printed in your environment to the site. Usually 0.0.0.0:3001 or localhost:3001


Extending this
-------------------------

If you want to extend this work, here are a few places to start:

* Get access to API with more detailed data preferably shorter ticks
* Include more graphs
* Improve buy and sell signals and explore more methods
